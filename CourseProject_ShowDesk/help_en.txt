INTRODUCTION

This program was created to automate processes related to managing concert, theater, or other event venues. It allows you to create a hall structure (stages, zones, seats), sell tickets, control seat occupancy, manage staff, and analyze sales statistics.

The main purpose of the program is to provide a tool for efficient event administration, reduce errors during ticket sales, ensure flexible role management, and create complete analytics on the venue's performance.

Each user has their own role (Administrator, Cashier, or Director), which determines the available functionality. For more information about each role’s functions, see the relevant sections.

Attention! If no users are registered in the system yet, access is possible only in the Director role without a password. It is recommended to check the functionality under each role after completing the initial system setup.

PROGRAM SETTINGS

1. Connecting to MongoDB

The program uses MongoDB as its primary data storage. Before starting, you must specify the MongoDB connection string in the settings. Example:  
mongodb://localhost:27017

If the server requires authorization, you must specify the login and password in the connection string.

At the first launch, the program will automatically create the database and collections if they do not exist.

Default collection names:
- Event - main event collection
- Employees - list of employees
- Stages - list of stages/halls
- UpcomingPerformances - list of upcoming performances
- PastPerformances - list of past performances

These names can be changed in the settings (Database tab).

2. Company Name

You must specify the company name in the settings, which will be printed at the top of the ticket.  
If not specified, the default title "ShowDesk" will appear on the tickets.

3. Initial Access to the Program

If the database does not contain any users:
- Access to the system is only possible in the Director role without a login and password.
- In this mode, the Director must create at least one user account and assign a role (Cashier, Administrator, Director).

After creating at least one Director account, further access to the system will only be possible with registered credentials.

Attention! Only a Director account has access to the Settings section!

4. Recommended Basic Settings

- Choose a folder for saving receipts.
- Set the currency symbol (₴, $, €).
- Configure standard ticket markups.
- Set minimum breaks between events and maximum event duration.
- Define the lists of professions, ticket types, souvenirs, and drinks.

WORKING WITH EVENTS

The "Working with Events" section allows managing all scheduled events that will take place at the venue.  
Each event has mandatory parameters that must be specified when creating:

- Event name
- Start date and time
- Base ticket price
- Event duration
- Stage or hall name

Section functionalities:

- Viewing events  
  The user can view the list of all created events. Sorting by name, date, duration, or price is available.

- Adding a new event  
  Creating an event is performed through a dedicated form. Correct dates, durations, and selected stage must be entered carefully.

- Editing events  
  The user can edit any parameters of an existing event (e.g., change event date or base ticket price).

- Deleting events  
  Before deleting an event, the system asks for confirmation to avoid accidental deletion.

- Archiving past events  
  After the event date, the program automatically moves the event to the "Past Performances" archive section.

Recommendation: Always verify the entered event data before saving to avoid schedule confusion.

TICKET SALES

The "Ticket Sales" section ensures the process of issuing tickets to clients and recording sales.

Section functionalities:

- Selecting an event for sale  
  The user selects an event from the available list, with search and filtering options.

- Viewing available seats  
  After selecting an event, the stage plan with zones and seats is displayed. Seats are marked with different colors depending on the status:
  - Available seat
  - Reserved or sold seat

- Selecting a seat  
  The user selects an available seat. The system automatically calculates the ticket price based on the seat category.

- Completing the sale  
  After selecting a seat, the "Sell Ticket" button is pressed. The ticket is saved to the database, and the seat becomes unavailable for further sales.

- Printing or saving the receipt  
  After a successful sale, the system offers to print or save the receipt as an electronic document.

- Sale errors  
  In case of errors (e.g., seat already occupied), the system will display an explanatory message and will not allow double-selling.

Recommendation: Always verify the selected seat before confirming the sale.

  The system can generate a report for a specific cashier to analyze individual performance.

- Exporting reports  
  Reports can be saved as files for further analysis or printing.

- Real-time monitoring
